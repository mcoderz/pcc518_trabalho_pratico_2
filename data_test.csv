test,coffee,0011800,european coffee trade proposes new quota formula author by jeremy lovell reutersauthor amsterdam june european coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating international coffee organization ico quotas dutch coffee trade association chairman chairman frits van horick said van horick who is a council member of the european coffee federation was speaking at the end of the ecf annual meeting the new formula is based on sixyear moving averages and would give brazil the worlds biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van horick said if accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ico the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van horick said coffee quotas were suspended in february last year when prices shot up on fears of a droughtinduced crop disaster in brazil although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on reintroduction brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota but our proposal leaves it very little to object to van horick said the existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as colombia kenya indonesia and costa rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the ivory coast el salvador and nicaragua would lose quota share van horick said because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent undershipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following years quota if the ico consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the september meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula van horick said at the same time much will depend on brazils attitude brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side if there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van horick added

test,yen,0010083,us said to view g meeting as major success author by peter torday reutersauthor washington april the united states which has long sought japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied tokyos latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies monetary sources said they believed that us treasury secretary james baker considered tokyos package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the japanese economy but yesterdays statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yens rise from around to the dollar the level at the february paris accord to about today and the initial reaction of currency markets in the far east demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so the yen sank below at one point despite intervention by the bank of japan kiichi miyazawa japans finance minister said the movement since paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the february talks i would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in paris miyazawa said yesterday the supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs was announced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve of miyazawas departure for washington to attend yesterdays meetings of leading industrial nations in a strongly worded statement terming the japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the paris accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt the dollars fall while relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years monetary sources also said they understood that secretary baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the japanese announcement they also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over mediumterm policies has replaced the bickering over shortterm differences in past meetings west germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the paris agreement appears from the face of yesterdays statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable bonns finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between west germany and japans trade surpluses and americas trade deficit have already taken place no mention was made however of the us commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of paris european nations and japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record us trade shortfall that reached nearly billion dlrs last year a similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier this week by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker a further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent fed to drive up interest rates monetary sources said that privately west germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the us unit bonn and other european nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts tokyos export drive to the united states the japanese monolith will concentrate on european markets the ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one canadian finance minister michael wilson said good progress was made wilson said they will meet before the june economic summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations the united states and france backed by the international monetary fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has bonn and london worried monetary sources say because it implies washington is moving in the direction of target zones the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the february meeting the concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the paris accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years
