inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the federal reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said if youre the fed theres no reason to do anything said steve slifer of lehman government securities inc there are hints that gnp is picking up on the inflation front all is well he said money supply is well under control its an absolutely ideal situation february us industrial production rose pct slightly less than the pct gain the financial markets had expected this compared with a slim pct rise in januarys production number previously reported as a pct increase the february us producer price index gained only pct less than a pct expected rise this followed a pct rise in the ppi in january the fed is going to look at this positively said allan leslie of discount corporation certainly inflation is not as bad as what volcker fed chairman has said lately industrial production growth is along the lines of what the fed wants the energy products component of ppi rose pct in february after a pct increase in january this shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from dlrs to dlrs per barrel said maria ramirez of drexel burnham lambert inc the trend is still pct in the first half of the year in declining energy prices contributed to a pct decline in the ppi economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not passenger car prices fell pct and light truck prices dropped pct yesterday federal reserve chairman paul volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the federal reserve the fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said robert brusca of nikko securities international while low inflation permits the fed to maintain an easier monetary policy brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar the outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said we need inflation for us producers to compete with foreign producers brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped pct in februarys ppi with many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for us competitiveness he said if further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in us debt brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices by contrast slifer said imported goods prices rose pct from first quarter to first quarter reflecting to a large degree a pct drop in the tradeweighted real value of the dollar from february to february slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar david wyss of data resources inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose pct at an annual rate in the second half of which has contributed to rising us industrial output its the other side of the lower dollar wyss said producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of pct in the first quarter its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive but stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc was not convinced that the february reports portend economic gains he said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in february business equipment production utilities output rose pct in february after gaining pct in january but roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to million units at an annual rate from million units in the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate roach said the disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories economists pointed to sharp rise in january us business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of january business inventories rose pct the largest gain since july when inventories rose pct the commerce department said business sales dropped pct in january the largest monthly sales drop on record nonetheless economists do not expect the fed to react to monthtomonth changes the fed has

developing worlds most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said that sounds like a reasonable strategy but there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation aldo roldan vice president for international services at chase econometrics said roldan told reuters that brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates roldan said the chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs but he added they are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels analysts said a key factor in brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background

exports following the breakdown of the ico talks on export quotas many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible steppedup brazilian marketing efforts they will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to richard loewy analyst for prudentialbache securities inc loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the brazil soybean crop brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they cant afford to store the crops he said the chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large south american crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields we are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our us exports loewy said tommy eshleman economist for the american soybean association asa said this years brazilian soybean harvest could total mln tonnes versus mln last year marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the us crop to bad growing weather another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the us government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral eshleman said he said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan were getting into a period when they brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export eshleman said but he added it will be a while before us exports fall to below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently jose melicias from the research department of drexel burnham lambert said brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation he said the debt situation was a major consideration the brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added asked if a return to an inflationary environment in brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops melicias said it would not make a big difference on other commodity markets brazils selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said the country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said brazils other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so i dont

with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of openended
